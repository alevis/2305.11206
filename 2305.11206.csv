"Abstract"
"Large language models are trained in two stages: (1) unsupervised pretraining from"
"raw text, to learn general-purpose representations, and (2) large scale instruction"
"tuning and reinforcement learning, to better align to end tasks and user preferences."
"We measure the relative importance of these two stages by training LIMA, a 65B"
"parameter LLaMa language model fine-tuned with the standard supervised loss on"
"only 1,000 carefully curated prompts and responses, without any reinforcement"
"learning or human preference modeling. LIMA demonstrates remarkably strong"
"performance, learning to follow specific response formats from only a handful of"
"examples in the training data, including complex queries that range from planning"
"trip itineraries to speculating about alternate history. Moreover, the model tends"
"to generalize well to unseen tasks that did not appear in the training data. In a"
"controlled human study, responses from LIMA are either equivalent or strictly"
"preferred to GPT-4 in 43% of cases; this statistic is as high as 58% when compared"
"to Bard and 65% versus DaVinci003, which was trained with human feedback."
"Taken together, these results strongly suggest that almost all knowledge in large"
"language models is learned during pretraining, and only limited instruction tuning"
"data is necessary to teach models to produce high quality output."

"1   Introduction"
"Language models are pretrained to predict the next token at an incredible scale, allowing them to"
"learn general-purpose representations that can be transferred to nearly any language understanding"
"or generation task. To enable this transfer, various methods for aligning language models have thus"
"been proposed, primarily focusing on instruction tuning [Mishra et al., 2021, Wei et al., 2022a, Sanh"
"et al., 2022] over large multi-million-example datasets [Chung et al., 2022, Beeching et al., 2023,"
"Köpf et al., 2023], and more recently reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [Bai"
"et al., 2022a, Ouyang et al., 2022], collected over millions of interactions with human annotators."
"Existing alignment methods require significant amounts of compute and specialized data to achieve"
"ChatGPT-level performance. However, we demonstrate that, given a strong pretrained language"
"model, remarkably strong performance can be achieved by simply fine-tuning on 1,000 carefully"
"curated training examples."
"We hypothesize that alignment can be a simple process where the model learns the style or format for"
"interacting with users, to expose the knowledge and capabilities that were already acquired during"

"2     Alignment Data"
"We define the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis: A model’s knowledge and capabilities are learnt"
"almost entirely during pretraining, while alignment teaches it which subdistribution of formats should"
"be used when interacting with users. If this hypothesis is correct, and alignment is largely about"
"learning style, then a corollary of the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis is that one could sufficiently"
"tune a pretrained language model with a rather small set of examples [Kirstain et al., 2021]."
"To that end, we collect a dataset of 1,000 prompts and responses, where the outputs (responses) are"
"stylistically aligned with each other, but the inputs (prompts) are diverse. Specifically, we seek outputs"
"in the style of a helpful AI assistant. We curate such examples from a variety of sources, primarily"
"split into community Q&A forums and manually authored examples. We also collect a test set of 300"
"prompts and a development set of 50. Table 1 shows an overview of the different data sources and"
"provides some statistics (see Appendix A for a selection of training examples)."
""
"2.1   Community Questions & Answers"
""
"We collect data from three community Q&A websites: Stack Exchange, wikiHow, and the Pushshift"
"Reddit Dataset [Baumgartner et al., 2020]. Largely speaking, answers from Stack Exchange and"
""
""
"2"
"wikiHow are well-aligned with the behavior of a helpful AI agent, and can therefore be mined"
"automatically, whereas highly upvoted Reddit answers tend to be humorous or trolling, requiring a"
"more manual approach to curate responses that follow the appropriate style."
""
"Stack Exchange Stack Exchange contains 179 online communities (exchanges), each one dedicated"
"to a specific topic, with the most popular one being programming (Stack Overflow). Users can post"
"questions, answers, comments and upvote (or downvote) all of the above. Thanks to active community"
"members and moderators, Stack Exchange has successfully maintained a high bar for content quality."
"We apply both quality and diversity controls when sampling from Stack Exchange. First, we divide"
"the exchanges into 75 STEM exchanges (including programming, math, physics, etc.) and 99 other"
"(English, cooking, travel, and more); we discard 5 niche exchanges. We then sample 200 questions"
"and answers from each set using a temperature of 𝜏 = 3 to get a more uniform sample of the different"
"domains. Within each exchange, we take the questions with the highest score that are self-contained"
"in the title (no body). We then select the top answer for each question, assuming it had a strong"
"positive score (at least 10). To conform with the style of a helpful AI assistant, we automatically filter"
"answers that are too short (less than 1200 characters), too long (more than 4096 characters), written"
"in the first person (“I”, “my”), or reference other answers (“as mentioned”, “stack exchange”,"
"etc); we also remove links, images, and other HTML tags from the response, retaining only code"
"blocks and lists. Since Stack Exchange questions contain both a title and a description, we randomly"
"select the title as the prompt for some examples, and the description for others."
""
"wikiHow wikiHow is an online wiki-style publication featuring over 240,000 how-to articles on a"
"variety of topics. Anyone can contribute to wikiHow, though articles are heavily moderated, resulting"
"in almost universally high-quality content. We sample 200 articles from wikiHow, sampling a category"
"first (out of 19) and then an article within it to ensure diversity. We use the title as the prompt (e.g. “How"
"to cook an omelette?”) and the article’s body as the response. We replace the typical “This"
"article...” beginning with “The following answer...”, and apply a number of preprocessing"
"heuristics to prune links, images, and certain sections of the text."
""
"The Pushshift Reddit Dataset Reddit is one of the most popular websites in the world, allowing"
"users to share, discuss, and upvote content in user-created subreddits. Due to its immense popularity,"
"Reddit is geared more towards entertaining fellow users rather than helping; it is quite often the case"
"that witty, sarcastic comments will obtain more votes than serious, informative comments to a post."
"We thus restrict our sample to two subsets, r/AskReddit and r/WritingPrompts, and manually select"
"examples from within the most upvoted posts in each community. From r/AskReddit we find 70"
"self-contained prompts (title only, no body), which we use for the test set, since the top answers are not"
"necessarily reliable. The WritingPrompts subreddit contains premises of fictional stories, which other"
"users are then encouraged to creatively complete. We find 150 prompts and high-quality responses,"
"encompassing topics such as love poems and short science fiction stories, which we add to the training"
"set. All data instances were mined from the Pushshift Reddit Dataset [Baumgartner et al., 2020]."
""
"2.2       Manually Authored Examples"
""
"To further diversify our data beyond questions asked by users in online communities, we collect"
"prompts from ourselves (the authors of this work). We designate two sets of authors, Group A and"
"Group B, to create 250 prompts each, inspired by their own interests or those of their friends.1 We"
"select 200 prompts from Group A for training and 50 prompts as a held-out development set. After"
"filtering some problematic prompts, the remaining 230 prompts from Group B are used for test."
"We supplement the 200 training prompts with high-quality answers, which we write ourselves."
"While authoring answers, we try to set a uniform tone that is appropriate for a helpful AI assistant."
"Specifically, many prompts will be answered with some acknowledgment of the question followed by"
"the answer itself. Preliminary experiments show that this consistent format generally improves model"
"performance; we hypothesize that it assists the model in forming a chain of thought, similar to the"
"“let’s think step-by-step” prompt [Kojima et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2022b]."
"1"
"Despite our efforts to prevent leakage, there was significant contact between the groups before the annotation"
"process, which resulted in certain shared priors that can be observed in the data."
""
""
"3"
"We also include 13 training prompts with some degree of toxicity or malevolence. We carefully write"
"responses that partially or fully reject the command, and explain why the assistant will not comply."
"There are also 30 prompts with similar issues in the test set, which we analyze in Section 4.3."
"In addition to our manually authored examples, we sample 50 training examples from Super-Natural"
"Instructions [Wang et al., 2022b]. Specifically, we select 50 natural language generation tasks such"
"as summarization, paraphrasing, and style transfer, and pick a single random example from each"
"one. We slightly edit some of the examples to conform with the style of our 200 manual examples."
"While the distribution of potential user prompts is arguably different from the distribution of tasks in"
"Super-Natural Instructions, our intuition is that this small sample adds diversity to the overall mix of"
"training examples, and can potentially increase model robustness."
"Manually creating diverse prompts and authoring rich responses in a uniform style is laborious. While"
"some recent works avoid manual labor via distillation and other automatic means [Honovich et al.,"
"2022, Wang et al., 2022a, Taori et al., 2023, Chiang et al., 2023, Sun et al., 2023], optimizing for"
"quantity over quality, this work explores the effects of investing in diversity and quality instead."

"3         Training LIMA"
"We train LIMA (Less Is More for Alignment) using the following protocol. Starting from LLaMa"
"65B [Touvron et al., 2023], we fine-tune on our 1,000-example alignment training set. To differentiate"
"between each speaker (user and assistant), we introduce a special end-of-turn token (EOT) at the end"
"of each utterance; this token plays the same role as EOS of halting generation, but avoids conflation"
"with any other meaning that the pretrained model may have imbued into the preexisting EOS token."
"We follow standard fine-tuning hyperparameters: we fine-tune for 15 epochs using"
"AdamW [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017] with 𝛽1 = 0.9, 𝛽2 = 0.95, and weight decay of 0.1."
"Without warmup steps, we set the initial learning rate to 1𝑒 − 5 and linearly decaying to 1𝑒 − 6 by"
"the end of training. The batch size is set to 32 examples (64 for smaller models), and texts longer"
"than 2048 tokens are trimmed. One notable deviation from the norm is the use of residual dropout;"
"we follow Ouyang et al. [2022] and apply dropout over residual connections, starting at 𝑝𝑑 = 0.0"
"at the bottom layer and linearly raising the rate to 𝑝𝑑 = 0.3 at the last layer (𝑝𝑑 = 0.2 for smaller"
"models). We find that perplexity does not correlate with generation quality, and thus manually select"
"checkpoints between the 5th and the 10th epochs using the held-out 50-example development set.2"

"examples, and often produces better-or-equal responses than GPT-4. Analyzing of LIMA generations"
"finds that 50% of its outputs are considered excellent. The fact that simple fine-tuning over so few"
"examples is enough to compete with the state of the art strongly supports the Superficial Alignment"

"large-scale instruction tuning and reinforcement learning approaches."

"of real user prompts during training, creating a very high bar. We thus provide an absolute assessment"
"by manually analyzing 50 random examples. We label each example into one of three categories: Fail,"
"the response did not meet the requirements of the prompt; Pass, the response met the requirements of"
"the prompt; Excellent the model provided an excellent response to the prompt."

"shows example LIMA outputs for parenting advice and generating a recipe.           75%"

"Out of Distribution How does LIMA perform on examples Of the 50"
"analyzed examples, 43 have a training example that is somewhat related in          50%"

"analyze 13 additional out-of-distribution examples (20 in total), and find"
"50%"
"that 20% of responses fail, 35% pass, and 45% are excellent. Although              25%"
"Excellent"
"this is a small sample, it appears that LIMA achieves similar absolute"

"LIMA’s response to 30 potentially sensitive prompts from the test set, and"
"find that LIMA responds safely to 80% of them (including 6 out of 10 prompts with malicious intent)."
"In some cases, LIMA outright refuses to perform the task (e.g. when asked to provide a celebrity’s"
